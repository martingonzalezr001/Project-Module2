Data Loading and Transformation

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is crucial for preparing the data for analysis. The process involves:

## Data Extraction

Extract data from csv files

Data Transformation

Cleanse and normalize data.

Create calculated columns and measures in Power BI using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
