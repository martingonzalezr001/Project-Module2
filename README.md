## Introduction

This project involves the creation of a data analysis dashboard to provide insights into key business metrics. The dashboard leverages Power BI for data visualization and analysis, offering a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to explore data trends, patterns, and actionable insights.

## Data Models


## Dashboard Mockup

Below is a conceptual mockup of the dashboard:

Sales Overview: Displays total sales, revenue, and profit by region and product category.

Customer Insights: Shows customer demographics, average purchase frequency, and top customers by revenue.

Time Series Analysis: Visualizes sales trends over time with filters for year, quarter, and month.

Product Performance: Highlights top-performing products by sales and profit margin.

Data Loading and Transformation

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is crucial for preparing the data for analysis. The process involves:

## Data Extraction

Extract data from csv files

Data Transformation

Cleanse and normalize data.

Create calculated columns and measures in Power BI using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).


## Architecture Diagram

The architecture diagram illustrates the data flow:

Data Sources: SQL databases, cloud storage, Excel sheets.

ETL Process: Data loading, transformation, and modeling in Power BI.

Power BI Dashboard: Visualization and reporting.
