## Introduction

This project involves the creation of a data analysis dashboard to provide insights into key business metrics. The dashboard leverages Power BI for data visualization and analysis, offering a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to explore data trends, patterns, and actionable insights.

Data Loading and Transformation

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is crucial for preparing the data for analysis. The process involves:

## Data Extraction

Extract data from csv files

Data Transformation

Cleanse and normalize data.

Create calculated columns and measures in Power BI using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).


## Architecture Diagram

The architecture diagram illustrates the data flow:

Data Sources: SQL databases, cloud storage, Excel sheets.

ETL Process: Data loading, transformation, and modeling in Power BI.
